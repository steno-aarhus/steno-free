All text below this is meant as examples of elements you can add to your
website. You should delete this text and replace it with your own text,
images, etc.

## Image example

![Example image
text](/_extensions/sdca-theme/images/banner.png){fig-alt="Abstract line art forming a continuous, looping wave pattern in red on a white background."}

```{=html}
<!--
Text inside blocks like this is not shown on the website. It is only for
you to read.

Notice that the "code" to add the image above has three elements:

1.  The part in the `[]`: This is the text that will be shown below the
    image. It is not necessary to add this text, but it can be good idea
    to add a short description of the image.

2.  The part in the `()`: This is the file path to the image. It is
    necessary to add this text, and it should be the path to the image
    you want to add.

3.  The part in the `{}`: The `fig-alt=""` part is the alternative text
    for the image. It's used by screen readers to describe the image to
    visually impaired users, so it is important for accessibility. The
    alt text should be a short description of the image.

```

## Button example

::: text-center
[A button linking to a page](https://add/your/link/here.com){.btn
.btn-primary role="button"}
:::

```{=html}
<!--
The "code" for the button has multiple elements as well:

1.  The part in the `[]`: This is the text that will be shown on the
    button.
2.  The part in the `()`: This is the link to the page you want to link
    to.
3.  The part in the `{}`: The `.btn` and `.btn-primary` are classes that
    style the button. Leave them as they are to keep the button styled
    as it is now. `role="button"` is a role that tells screen readers 
    that this is a button, which is important for accessibility.
4.  The `text-center` part is a class that centers the button on the
    page. You can remove it if you want the button to be left-aligned.
-->
```

## Profile picture example

::: text-center
![Anna
Andersen](/_extensions/sdca-theme/images/home-banner.jpg){.profile-picture
fig-alt="Image of Anna Andersen"}
:::

```{=html}
<!--
The "code" for adding a "profile-picture" (which is an image with
rounded corners) has the same elements as the image example above, but 
with a different class in the `{}` part, namely `.profile-picture`.

The `text-center` part is a class that centers the image text on the page,
which is the text in the `[]` part. 

You can remove `text-center` along
with the `:::` before and after the image if you want the text to be
left-aligned.

In a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and meandering
streams, the locals gathered every weekend for a lively farmers' market.
The air was filled with the enticing aroma of freshly baked bread and
the vibrant colors of stalls displaying an array of fruits and
vegetables. Children laughed as they chased each other through the
cobblestone streets, creating a joyful symphony that echoed through the
charming community.

Meanwhile, high above the village, fluffy clouds painted the sky in hues
of pink and orange as the sun began its descent. A lone eagle soared
gracefully, riding the warm currents of air. In the distance, the
silhouette of an ancient castle stood tall on a hill, silently
witnessing the passage of time. As evening descended, the village
transformed into a tranquil oasis, the soft glow of lanterns casting a
warm and enchanting ambiance over the cobblestone streets.
